<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizontal Screw Conveyors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shafted Convoyers</li><li>Shaftless Convoyers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The horizontal screw conveyors market can be divided into two main types: shafted and shaftless conveyors. Shafted conveyors feature a central rotating shaft with spiral flights, suitable for handling a range of materials and offering effective control over the flow. In contrast, shaftless conveyors utilize a spiral that moves material along a trough without a central shaft, enabling the transport of bulkier materials and reducing maintenance needs. Both types cater to diverse industries, emphasizing efficiency and adaptability in material handling.</p></p>
